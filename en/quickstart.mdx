# 1. Setup

Your board will be prepared by performing the following four main steps.

<Note>The term "image" generally refers to a file with the .img extension, which contains the files and drivers
of the Linux operating systemâ€”essentially everything needed for the board to function. You can download and examine
the file named "minimal" from https://packages.t3gemstone.org/images/ubuntu/jammy/t3-gem-o1.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the image writing application">
    This is the process of downloading the desktop application used to install and customize the operating system on the board.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write the image to the development board">
    This is the process of installing software on the board and preparing it using the Gemstone Imager application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change the bootmode switch to boot the development board from the SD card">
    The development board can optionally be used with an `SD card` or `eMMC`. This section shows how to make this selection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Establish a connection between the computer and the development board">
    These are the steps to connect to the development board and access the system inside it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 1.1. Image writing application

All core software on Gemstone, such as the
[Operating System](https://preprod.kureansiklopedi.com/tr/detay/isletim-sistemleri),
[Bootloader](https://preprod.kureansiklopedi.com/tr/detay/bootloader), and
[Firmware](https://preprod.kureansiklopedi.com/tr/detay/firmware), is installed using the Gemstone
Image Writer (GemImager or Gemstone Imager) application. Download the appropriate application
(Linux, Windows, or macOS) for your computer from http://www.t3gemstone.org/software.

Gemstone uses a Ubuntu/Debian-based operating system, with different variations available depending on project
needs. The documentation [later sections](./distros/introduction) explain which version to use for which tasks,
but a summary is provided below:

* **Desktop:** An image that includes software such as a browser (Firefox), text editor, code development
  environment (VSCode), and video player (VLC), allowing the board to be used as a computer. This image is
  larger than the other two types and is mostly used for prototyping, testing, and development activities.
  (For robotics work, the Minimal image is more suitable.)

* **Kiosk:** An image that supports a graphical interface, often used for touch panels, **without** the text
  editor or applications found in the Desktop image. (For example, the touch panel used for media control in Tesla
  vehicles or the control screen inside passenger vehicles in Teknofest competitions.)

* **Minimal:** This image contains a real-time Linux kernel and is optimized for IoT, robotics, and autopilot
  applications. It is a powerful and deterministic structure suitable for embedded software system development projects.

#### 1.2.5. Select the storage device (SD card/eMMC)

After connecting your SD card and reader to your computer, the Gemstone Imager application will list the relevant
device as shown in the screenshot below.

<Frame caption="SD card or eMMC selection">
  <img src="/images/gem-imager/d-select-storage.png" />
</Frame>

After completing all three selections, click the **Next button** as shown below.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/gem-imager/g-prepare.png" />
</Frame>

#### 1.2.6. Customize the system

After completing the above selections, the **System Customization** screen will automatically open. This screen
is used to set the board's login password and enable certain services to start automatically.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="General Settings">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gem-imager/e-setting-1.png" />
    </Frame>

    * Enter an 8-character password in the **Password** field on the screen. This password is for the "gemstone" user 
      account in the Linux operating system and will be required when accessing the board.

    * If you want the board to connect to a Wi-Fi network after completing the image writing process and powering 
      it on, check the "Configure wireless LAN" option and enter the Wi-Fi network name and password.

        <Warning>Note: Make sure you enter the correct Wi-Fi network name (Access Point Name) and password.</Warning>

    * Finally, check the **Set locale settings** option and select the keyboard language for the Gemstone board.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Services" >
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gem-imager/f-setting-2.png" />
    </Frame>

    * **Enable SSH:** (Secure Shell) This option is required for Terminal connection to the board via 
      Ethernet, as explained later in this section. For images like Minimal and Kiosk, which lack desktop
      components, Ethernet/SSH or Serial Port/Console is often used.

    * **Enable VNC:** When using Desktop-type images, [t3-gem-vnc](https://github.com/t3gemstone/t3-gem-vnc) allows 
      you to eliminate the need for a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This service enables you to connect to
      the board's desktop via a browser by connecting the board's Ethernet cable to your computer.

    * **Gadgets:** When you connect your Gemstone board to your computer via USB Type-C, this feature allows
      the board to obtain a virtual IP without needing an Ethernet cable, create a serial port, and use 
      the board's disk as storage (similar to connecting a phone to your computer).

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

After customization, click the **Save** button to proceed to the next step.

#### 1.2.7. Start the writing process

After completing all the above steps, you will be asked to confirm before starting the image writing
process, and the copying process will begin.

After the writing process is successfully completed, remove the SD card from the reader and insert it into
the Gemstone. Then, set the Bootmode pins to "SD card" as explained in the next section.

<Frame caption="Insert the SD card">
  <img className="rounded-lg" src="/images/o1-board/04-back-sdcard.png" />
</Frame>

### 1.3. Bootmode Switch

<Tooltip tip="Boot mode change switch"> Bootmode switch</Tooltip> is used to determine how and where
(from which disk) the system will boot when power is first applied to the board, or for purposes 
such as <Tooltip tip="Debugging">Debug</Tooltip> during software development.

The table and screenshot below list all the Boot modes available on the Gemstone O1 development board. This
section explains the installation process for the SD card, while the
[use of eMMC (embedded disk on the board)](./imager/emmc) will be discussed in later sections.

The SD card is often preferred for quick testing and development activities due to its convenience, but data
loss can occur in systems with vibration. If you plan to use the board on a moving platform, eMMC is more suitable.

<Frame caption="Bootmode switch">
  <img className="rounded-lg" src="/images/o1-board/06-bootmode-2.png" />
</Frame>

<SnippetBootmode desc="Image"/>

### 1.4. Connect the board to the computer

After connecting the USB Type-C and Ethernet cables from the package to your computer and the development
board as shown in the photo below, you are ready to explore the board!

<Frame caption="Connecting the board to the computer">
  <img className="rounded-lg" src="/images/o1-board/10-ethernet-typec.png" />
</Frame>

# 2. Explore Gemstone

The following steps are for using your Gemstone development board via your computer (for example, connecting
to the board's desktop via a browser or performing operations via Serial Port/Terminal command line). If you
have the option to connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, you can also explore the board this way!

<Accordion title="What is a Terminal?">
  Terminal or Console refers to a method (Command Line Interface) where you can perform operations by writing
  commands without a graphical interface, windows, or buttons. Examples include **CMD, Powershell** on
  Windows or the **Terminal** application on Unix/POSIX-based operating systems. A sample screenshot is provided below.
  <Frame>
    <img height="600" width="800" src="/images/terminal-windows.png" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

After setup, you can check whether the board has a network connection via the Ethernet and USB Type-C you connected
or, as explained in the [System Customization](./quickstart#1-2-6-sistem-Ã¶zelleÅŸtir) section, if Wi-Fi settings were
configured, by observing the
<Tooltip tip="If an IP address could not be obtained, this LED will blink; if an IP address is obtained, it will stay lit continuously.">green LED staying lit continuously</Tooltip>.

<Warning>
When connecting the board via USB Type-C to a Windows host computer, some drivers need to be installed to
use the USB storage, USB Ethernet and USB serial port features. For instructions,
please [click here](https://www.diodes-delight.com/docs/piunora/usb-gadget/).
</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img className="rounded-lg" src="/images/o1-board/11-ethernet-typec-2.png" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Serial Port">
    Connect to the board using a USB TTL Serial converter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="VNC">
    Connect to the board via a browser (Firefox/Chrome).
  </Step>
  <Step title="SSH">
    Connect to the board via a Terminal/Console application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2.1. Serial Port

The USB TTL converter cable is often used to connect to the board via serial port when an Ethernet connection is
not available. Normally, when you connect your Gemstone board to your computer via a USB Type-C cable, if the
"Gadgets" option under Services in the [System Customization](./quickstart#1-2-6-sistem-Ã¶zelleÅŸtir) section is
checked, a serial port connection is possible without needing a TTL cable. However, if unexpected issues arise
during development and these features do not work, you can still connect to the board using a USB TTL cable.

An advantage of this method is that it allows you to view the console outputs of U-Boot, the preloader (Bootloader) on
Gemstone boards. While network initialization is required for outputs to appear over Ethernet, with TTL, outputs are
visible from the start.

#### 2.1.1. Terminal/Console Application

For Terminal/Console operations, you can use [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) on Windows, Gnome Terminal on Linux,
or Terminal on macOS. This documentation will use [Tabby.sh](https://tabby.sh/), an application that works on all
three operating systems.

#### 2.1.2. Download the application

Go to [Tabby.sh](https://tabby.sh/) and click the **Download** button to download the software suitable for your
operating system.

<Frame caption="https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby/releases" >
  <img src="/images/tabbysh-terminal-website.png" />
</Frame>

After completing the installation, run it and select the serial port as shown in the screenshot below.

<Frame caption="Todo: Tabby terminal and serial port">
  <img className="rounded-lg" noZoom src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

### 2.2. VNC remote desktop connection via browser

<Note>
The VNC service is only available with the [Desktop image](./distros/desktop).
</Note>

After connecting your Gemstone development board to your computer via a USB Type-C cable, you can access the
desktop via a browser using the following link.

<Tip>
[https://192.168.7.2:8443/vnc.html](https://192.168.7.2:8443/vnc.html)
</Tip>

<Frame caption="Certificate Error Screen (You can proceed from the Advanced section)">
  <img src="/images/vnc-cert.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
The reason for the browser's certificate error when connecting is that the VNC server uses a self-signed
certificate. This is normal.
</Note>

<Frame caption="Password Screen (Enter the VNC password you set in Gemstone Imager)">
  <img src="/images/vnc-pass.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/vnc-desktop.png" />
</Frame>

### 2.3. SSH connection over the network

<Note>
For a faster and more stable console experience, it is recommended to use SSH over serial port for console access.
</Note>

After connecting your Gemstone development board to your computer via a USB Type-C cable, run the following
command in the terminal.

```bash
ssh gemstone@192.168.7.2
```

### 2.4. Update the Gemstone operating system

Gemstone development boards include a Debian/Ubuntu-based operating system with a customized real-time Linux kernel.
While the version you installed via GemImager is up-to-date, you can update any installed Ubuntu/Debian packages
(if available) using the following method.

<Note>
Note: The following operations should be performed on the board via the Terminal icon in the top menu when
connected via remote desktop in a browser or via SSH/Console from your computer. If you have no prior
experience with Linux, you can gain experience by reading the [Getting Started section](./guides/basic) in
the [Training Guides](./guides/introduction).
</Note>

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### 2.5. WiFi Connection

If you wish to connect the development board to a new WiFi network after the initial setup, rather than
during it, open a Terminal using any of the methods described above to connect to the board.
Then, run the command `sudo nmtui` and select the network information you wish to join from
the **Activate Connection** section. An example is provided in the video below.
After this process, your development board will join the specified WiFi network and obtain an
IP address. Consequently, you will be able to establish an SSH connection to the respective IP address
from your laptop/computer.

<Frame caption="Todo: asciinema record gif -> minicom ttl -> gemstone@t3-gem-o1 $ sudo nmtui -> sudo ip a">
  <img className="rounded-lg" noZoom src="/images/under-construction.png" />
