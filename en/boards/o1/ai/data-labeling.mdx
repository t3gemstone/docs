This section will provide information on how to perform labeling operations when you want to train your own models.

Label Studio is an open-source platform for managing labeling (annotation) and data preparation processes for different data types.
It allows labeling on image, text, audio, video, or time series data and facilitates the preparation of datasets to be used in training machine learning models.

Start Label Studio on the edgeai-tensorlab environment using the following command.

<Note>
Before performing these operations, you must have completed the installation of the edgeai-tensorlab project from the previous step and be operating inside the distrobox using ```task box```.
</Note>

```bash
task label-studio
```

On this screen, you need to enter the label names that will be used in your model. Each line will be defined as one label. You can add label names by clicking the "Add" button, and you can edit the colors or delete the added labels by clicking on them. After adding all the labels, you can create your project by pressing the "Save" button.
