<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will gain experience in the following topics:

- Using GPIO via Gemstone
- Preliminary preparation for the [t3gemstone/examples/gpio](https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples/tree/main/gpio) project.
</Tip>

GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) refers to pins used for general-purpose input and output operations in
microcontrollers and development boards. These pins can be configured for both receiving digital data (input)
and sending digital signals (output). Below is an example of an LED blink operation performed via GPIO pins on the Gemstone.

In addition to the materials listed on the [Quick Start](/en/quickstart) page, you will need an LED, a button, 
and a resistor.

## 1. Turning on an LED

### 1.1. GPIO Connections

Connect the LED to GPIOX on the Gemstone, which is available for Input/Output, as shown below.

</Frame>

### 1.2. Creating a Shell Script

After connecting to the Gemstone, create a script file for the LED blink operation.

```bash
touch led-blink.sh
```

Open the `led-blink.sh` file using the `nano` text editor in the terminal interface.

```bash
nano led-blink.sh
```

Copy and paste the following code into the `led-blink.sh` file.

<SnippetExamplesGpioScript />

Press `CTRL+X`, then `Y` to exit the nano editor and save the file.

### 1.3. Running the Shell Script

Make the `led-blink.sh` file executable using the `chmod` command.

```bash
chmod +x led-blink.sh
```

Run the `led-blink.sh` script.

```bash
./led-blink.sh
```

Finally, observe the LED blinking at 1-second intervals as shown in the video below.

## 2. Reading a Button and Turning on an LED

### 2.1. GPIO Connections

Connect the LED to GPIOX and the button to GPIOY on the Gemstone, as shown below.

</Frame>

### 2.2. Creating a Shell Script

Create the script file.

```bash
touch button-led.sh
```

Open the `button-led.sh` file using the `nano` text editor in the terminal interface.

```bash
nano button-led.sh
```

Copy and paste the following code into the `button-led.sh` file.

<SnippetExamplesLedScript />

Press `CTRL+X`, then `Y` to exit the nano editor and save the file.

### 2.3. Running the Shell Script

Make the `button-led.sh` file executable using the `chmod` command.

```bash
chmod +x button-led.sh
```

Run the `button-led.sh` script.

```bash
./button-led.sh
```

Finally, observe the LED turning on while the button is pressed, as shown in the video below.
