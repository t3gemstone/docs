<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will gain experience in the following topics:

- Establishing a serial port connection between the developer's computer and the Gemstone board using a USB TTL cable.
- Communicating between both computers via a terminal.
- Preliminary preparation for the [t3gemstone/examples/serial](https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples/tree/main/serial) project.
</Tip>

A serial port is a communication channel that enables data transmission between devices such as computers and
microcontrollers. This communication typically occurs via the `UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)`
protocol and is ideal for low-speed data transmission. For example, serial ports are often preferred when
communicating with external modules like GPS or Radio Transmitters.

<Steps>
  <Step title="SSH/VNC Connection">
  Connect to the development board using one of the methods: [SSH](../../../quickstart#2-3-network-connection-via-ssh) or
  [VNC](../../../quickstart#2-2-remote-desktop-connection-via-browser-with-vnc).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Shell">
  Create Bash Shell scripts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="TTL and Terminal">
  Connect the developer's computer and the Gemstone board using a TTL cable and perform data exchange via the Tabby.sh terminal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 1. Creating a Shell Script

Create a script file for opening the serial port and sending data.

```bash
touch serial-test.sh
```

### 2. Using a Text Editor

Open the `serial-test.sh` file using the `nano` text editor from the terminal interface.

```bash
nano serial-test.sh
```

After copying the following code, paste it into the `serial-test.sh` file.

Press `CTRL+X`, then press `Y` to save and exit the nano editor.

### 3. Running the Shell Script

Make the `serial-test.sh` file executable using the `chmod` command and start it.
