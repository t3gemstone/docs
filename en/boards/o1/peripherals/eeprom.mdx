<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will gain experience in the following topics:

- Technical specifications and usage examples of the EEPROM available in Gemstone
</Tip>

EEPROMs are generally used to store hardware or software parameters that can be configured on the board,
board-specific information (product type, serial number, etc.), or firmware (BIOS, etc.) because they do
not contain a file system, provide fast access during boot, and can retain stored data for a very long time
without corruption.

<Note>
While SD Cards and USB Flash drives can store data for up to 10 years without corruption, the AT24C512C
model EEPROM can retain data for 40 years without corruption.
</Note>

## EEPROM Usage

The board includes a 512-Kbit (64KiB) AT24C512C model EEPROM connected to the SoC via the I2C bus.
The necessary drivers for Linux are pre-installed, and it is defined in the [Device Tree](/en/faq#what-is-device-tree)
 as follows:

<SnippetDTB />

After connecting to the board's terminal, the following command should display a folder named `2-0051`:

<SnippetAt24 />

<Note>
In the folder name, `2` indicates that the EEPROM is on I2C bus 2 (i.e., wkup_i2c0), and `0051` indicates
that its I2C address is 0x51.
</Note>

In the example below, the file named `eeprom` is generated by the `at24` driver and allows accessing the
EEPROM as a file in Linux, enabling read and write operations.

### Using EEPROM via Terminal

The following command completely erases the EEPROM:

<Note>
Since the EEPROM used on the T3-GEM-O1 board is 512 kilobits (64KiB), the count (number of bytes to write) is
set to 65536 (64 x 1024).
</Note>

<SnippetTerminal />

<Note>
As seen in the `dd` output, the EEPROM write speed is `0.2 kB/s`, meaning we can write 200 bytes per second.
One disadvantage of EEPROMs is their very low write speed.
</Note>

The following command can be used to write data to the EEPROM:

<SnippetWrite />

To perform a read operation, the following command can be executed:

<SnippetRead />

For EEPROM read and write operations, examine the following usage examples in Python and C:
