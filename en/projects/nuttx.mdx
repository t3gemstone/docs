<Warning>
NuttX support for Gemstone is still in the development phase. It is not possible to use all peripherals on the board
such as I2C, SPI, PWM, CAN Bus.
</Warning>

NuttX is an open-source operating system designed for real-time applications. Compliant with POSIX and ANSI standards,
NuttX is optimized especially for embedded systems and microcontrollers. The primary reason for choosing NuttX for the
R5F cores on the Gemstone board is its deterministic behavior and its ability to reliably manage real-time tasks.
Additionally, NuttX is critical for drone and autonomous vehicle projects because it is a platform supported by popular
autopilot software like Ardupilot and PX4.

Since there is no official NuttX support for the AM67A SoC yet, a custom `nsh` configuration has been created in the
`boards/arm/am67/t3-gem-o1` directory. With this configuration, NuttX can be run on the R5F cores on our board, which
are suitable for real-time processing.

## 1. Compilation

### 1.1. Toolchain Installation

To compile NuttX, we need a cross-compiler compatible with ARM Cortex-R5F cores. The `gcc-arm-none-eabi` toolchain is
the standard solution that meets this need.

On Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can install the toolchain using the package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from ARM's official site and perform a manual installation. After
installation, you can verify the toolchain is working correctly with the `arm-none-eabi-gcc --version` command.

### 1.2. Downloading Source Codes

The NuttX ecosystem consists of two main repositories: the core operating system and the application framework. To
download the versions customized for the Gemstone board, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the main NuttX repository
git clone https://github.com/t3gemstone/nuttx.git

# Clone NuttX applications as the 'apps' folder
git clone https://github.com/t3gemstone/nuttx-apps.git apps

# Change to your main working directory
cd nuttx
```

This configuration creates the standard directory structure expected by NuttX. The `apps` folder contains the
applications and services that will run on the operating system.

### 1.3. Applying the Default Configuration

NuttX uses pre-prepared configurations for different hardware platforms. Let's start by applying the `t3-gem-o1:nsh`
configuration for our Gemstone board:

```bash
./tools/configure.sh -l t3-gem-o1:nsh
```

This command configures the basic settings appropriate for the AM67A SoC's features and activates a simple command-line
interface called NuttShell (nsh). NuttShell allows you to perform basic file operations and system management tasks on
the system.

### 1.5. Compiling the Project

After the configuration is complete, we can compile NuttX:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

This command performs a parallel compilation using all the CPU cores available on your system. The compilation results
in an ELF file named `nuttx`. This file contains the operating system image to be loaded onto the R5F core.

### 1.6. Customizing the Configuration

Sometimes you may need to make changes to the default configuration. NuttX uses the `menuconfig` tool, similar to the
Linux kernel. Through this graphical interface, you can activate drivers, change memory settings, or add new features.
Your changes are stored in the `.config` file.

```bash
make menuconfig
```

To make your changes permanent and able to be added to the version control system, use the `savedefconfig` command. This
command saves only the configurations that differ from the default settings, thus preventing the configuration file from
becoming unnecessarily large. You can copy the resulting `defconfig` file to the `nsh` default configuration under the
`boards/arm/am67/t3-gem-o1/configs` directory or create a new configuration with a different name.

```bash
make savedefconfig
```

### 1.7. Cleanup Operations

During development, you may sometimes need a fresh start. NuttX offers two levels of cleanup commands:

```bash
# Only cleans object files and binaries
make clean

# Cleans all build files and the configuration
make distclean
```

The `make clean` command deletes the files resulting from the compilation but preserves the configuration. `make
distclean` completely reverts the project to its initial state, in which case you need to perform the configuration
process again.

## 2. Running

While the NuttX operating system runs on the R5F cores, the Linux operating system also runs on the A53 cores. Code can
be loaded onto the R5F cores using the `remoteproc` mechanism present in the Linux operating system and U-Boot.

Program files to be loaded onto the cores via remoteproc must be copied to the `/lib/firmware` directory with predefined
names. At system startup, the remoteproc mechanism will automatically load the programs onto the relevant cores. Follow
the steps below to run NuttX using remoteproc.

1.  Copy the `nuttx` file resulting from the compilation to the `/lib/firmware` directory with the name `j722s-main-r5f0_0-fw`.
2.  Reboot the board.
3.  You can access NuttShell by connecting a USB-to-TTL device to the UART-MAIN1's GPIO-14 (TX) and GPIO-15 (RX) pins on the 40-pin HAT.
4.  From the opened `nsh` console, you can run the program named `blink` and observe the user LEDs on the board blinking.

## 3. Debug

### 3.1. Enabling Debug Features

NuttX is configured in release mode by default, which produces a small-sized ELF file that is optimized but contains no
debug information. To perform step-by-step debugging during development, you will need to switch to debug mode.

Open the `menuconfig` tool and follow this path: `Build Setup` → `Debug Options` → `Enable Debug Features`. Also, enable
the `Generate Debug Symbols` option. These settings cause the compiler to embed debug information into the ELF, allowing
the debugger to debug at the source code level.

### 3.2. CCS IDE Integration

Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio (CCS) is a development environment specifically optimized for the AM67A SoC
family. To integrate your NuttX project into CCS, open the IDE and use `File` → `Import` → `C/C++` → `Existing Code as
Makefile Project`. Select the `nuttx` folder as the project directory.

### 3.3. Loading the Program onto the Core

To start the debug process via the CCS IDE, first create a Target Configuration by selecting the Debug Probe model you
will use (e.g., Texas Instruments XDS200) and the `J722S_TDA4VEN_TDA4AEN_AM67` board. Then, start the Target
Configuration and connect to the AM67A SoC.

After the debugger connection is established, select the Main R5F core and use `Run` → `Load` → `Load Program` to select
the `nuttx` ELF file. This operation loads the NuttX operating system into the R5F core's memory.

Once the program is loaded, you can set breakpoints, watch variables, and step through the code. You can examine
critical components of NuttX, such as its task scheduler and interrupt handlers, in detail this way.
