Imagine you're working on a robotic arm for factory automation. On a moving production line, 
products of different colors pass by, and your system detects these products using cameras 
and sensors on the robotic arm, then sorts them into different boxes based on color. 
What would be the impact if your robotic arm responded 1 second late when detecting a red product?

For unmanned vehicles especially, it's crucial that the system boots quickly after powering on 
the Gemstone board and that your applications respond and take action within expected timeframes. 
When developing such embedded projects for drone applications, low-footprint, deterministic, 
real-time operating systems are typically used. For example, the [PX4](https://mth.tc/gkgIy) 
flight controller uses [Apache NuttX](https://github.com/t3gemstone/NuttX) OS, while other 
systems often prefer operating systems like [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/00-Overview).

The Linux kernel also has real-time capabilities like 
[TÃ¼bitak GzIS](https://preprod.kureansiklopedi.com/tr/detay/tubitak-gis-gercek-zamanli-isletim-sistemi-69507), 
NuttX, FreeRTOS, vxWorks, and [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/). Unlike these systems, 
Linux offers the significant advantage of supporting hundreds of open-source projects. 
(See example article [here](https://mth.tc/jRzV))

The Gemstone Minimal image is optimized for fast boot times and deterministic behavior. 
It does **not** include a desktop environment or graphical interface - only the essential 
packages and drivers required for system operation are installed. This optimization reduces 
the image size, enables faster boot times, and allows more efficient use of system resources.

1. Contains all hardware drivers like other images - serial ports, CANBUS, Ethernet etc. are fully supported
2. Ideal for projects without graphical requirements like IoT, unmanned vehicles, and automation systems
