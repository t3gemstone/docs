This section contains information about the scope of the T3 Gemstone Project, what kind of work can be done, methods 
for software development, and an introduction to the ecosystem.

<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will have knowledge about the following topics:

* The components of the Gemstone development board's Hardware and Software studies.
* Methods for compiling software on the board or on a Ubuntu computer.
* What the projects in the Github repositories are.
</Tip>

# 1. Ecosystem

The Gemstone project is entirely composed of open-source software and hardware components. This means you can
redesign your own systems using the electronic designs of the development board and freely use the software
components and codes by making changes, as outlined in the [End User License](./license) section regarding what
considerations should be taken into account.

To exemplify the projects in which the development boards can be used, a list is provided below, and your
contributions on what else can be added are welcome!

1. Flight control and auxiliary mission computer for unmanned aerial, ground, and underwater vehicles.
2. Agricultural vehicles, virtual reality glasses, smart home studies, IoT, Robotics, Industrial arms.
3. Camera systems using image processing and artificial intelligence together.
4. Embedded computer for autonomous robotics studies.
5. Touch panels and kiosk screens in command and control systems.

Dozens of different examples of the studies listed and new technology news are regularly published on the
[Community Forums](https://community.t3gemstone.org/c/blog/71).

### 1.1. Development Board / Embedded Computer

Gemstone products are mostly used in embedded technology studies and are equipped with various sensors and 
peripheral devices. It is possible to create projects such as processing data from sensors and cameras via 
communication methods like serial port, CanBUS, I2C, SPI, Ethernet, and controlling various motors 
and actuators.

The hardware designs (PCB, etc.) of the _T3-GEM-O1_ development board are available 
[at this address](http://github.com/t3gemstone/hardware). Examples of how to use the hardware on it are explained 
in the later ([Development Boards](./boards/o1/introduction)) sections.

### 1.2. Operating System

Gemstone runs on a GNU/Linux operating system. It includes components such as the 
[Kernel](https://github.com/t3gemstone/linux), [Bootloader (U-Boot)](https://github.com/t3gemstone/u-boot), 
[Distribution (Distro)](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/tree/main/distro), and Firmware. Tools like 
[Yocto Project](https://preprod.kureansiklopedi.com/tr/detay/yocto-projesi-the-yocto-project-b9e7e) and 
[Debootstrap](https://github.com/t3gemstone/debos) were used to assemble the system.

As GNU/Linux distributions ([Distro](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/tree/main/distro)), Debian, Ubuntu, 
and Poky are used. The use of Debian or Ubuntu is offered as selectable, as it may vary depending on the board's needs.

Various package management systems are used to perform software updates in GNU/Linux operating systems. For 
example, in the [Quick Start](./quickstart#2-4-update-the-gemstone-operating-system) section, an Ubuntu 
update example was given for system updates.

Similarly, the https://packages.t3gemstone.org/apt package management system is used for all customized kernel, 
driver, etc., software for T3 Gemstone boards. When you run the update command, the latest packages
— _if available_ — are downloaded from the servers.

<Tip>The operating system distribution used for Gemstone can also be used for BeagleBoard's BeagleY-AI. If you select 
BeagleY-AI as the Board in the GemImager application, the created SD card can be used on the BeagleY-AI board. 
Gemstone's operating system distribution is more powerful and up-to-date than what Beagleboard offers.</Tip>

For faster boot times, various customizations in the Linux kernel and [Device Tree](/en/faq#what-is-device-tree) changes for driver selections of the 
hardware included in the development boards are available in the 
[github repository](https://github.com/t3gemstone/linux/tree/v6.1.83-ti-rt-arm64-r67-t3-gem-o1).

### 1.3. SDK (Software Development Kit)

The [T3 Gemstone SDK](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk) is used to compile and assemble all the components 
mentioned above — _kernel, bootloader, distribution, etc._ — tools, packages, and software, and to create image files. 
While the README file of the relevant repository briefly explains how to use it, more detailed explanations are 
provided in the [SDK](./sdk/introduction) section of this Documentation. Tools such as 
[Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox), [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox), 
[Debos](https://github.com/t3gemstone/debos), and [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) used in the SDK work are 
areas that require extensive knowledge, so helpful resources are provided at the end of the documentation based 
on your interests.

### 1.4. Github Repository

The purposes of the projects in the T3 Gemstone Github repository are listed in the table below.

# 2. Development

Software development processes can be done in two ways. The first is compiling directly on the board using the 
compilation tools on the board, while the second method is called Cross Compilation, where you compile projects 
on your own computer and then upload them to the board. Both methods and their advantages are explained below.

<Frame caption="Todo: Image summarizing Host (x86-64) and Target (aarch64) concepts">
  <img className="rounded-lg" noZoom src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

### 2.1. Software Development on the Board

Example projects in C/C++/Python on how to use the components such as sensors, communication data lines, cameras, 
artificial intelligence, and network on the Gemstone Obsidian development board are available at 
https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples. Below, the process of downloading and compiling this project on 
the board is explained, and each component is separately described in the Development boards section.

<Tip>
This section shows how to download the t3gemstone/examples project onto the board, compile it, and run the examples.
For more detailed information check out the README.md file of t3gemstone/examples project.
</Tip>

#### 2.1.1. Clone example projects with Git

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ git clone https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples.git
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ cd examples
```

#### 2.1.2. Install libraries and additional tools needed for compilation

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ sudo apt install -y build-essential libncurses-dev libgpiod-dev
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ ./setup.sh
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ devbox shell
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ task fetch
```

#### 2.1.3. Compile an example project

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ CROSS_COMPILE=false PROJECT=magnetometer task build
```

#### 2.1.4. Run the compiled project

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ sudo ./build/examples/magnetometer/c/magnetometer
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ sudo ./build/examples/magnetometer/cpp/magnetometer
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:examples$ sudo ./build/examples/magnetometer/python/magnetometer
```

### 2.2. Software Development on the Developer's Computer

While it is possible to compile projects on the board as described above, compiling on your Laptop or Desktop 
GNU/Linux operating system has some advantages. For example, while the _T3-GEM-O1_ board has 4GB of Memory, your 
Laptop may have 16/32GB of Memory and a more advanced Processor. Therefore, Cross Compile Toolchains are used to 
speed up compilation processes.

<Note>
Development boards mostly have ARM architecture processors, laptops and desktops mostly have Intel x86-64 
architecture processors. In this case, Cross Compilation tools provide the ability to compile for different 
architectures.
</Note>

#### 2.2.1. Establish Ethernet connection between Gemstone board and your computer

Connect one end of Ethernet cable to Gemstone board and the other end to your computer.
After that set static IP to your computer as shown below.

      <img className="rounded-lg" noZoom src="/images/under-construction.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After setting your computer's IP, get a shell from Gemstone board via [serial port](./quickstart#2-1-serial-port)
and run the commands below. A new connection for static IP will be created and its priority will be set higher
than DHCP via `nmcli` tool. That way static IP will be assigned automatically.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo nmcli connection add \
  con-name "eth0-static" \
  ifname eth0 type ethernet \
  ip4 10.0.0.1/24 \
  connection.autoconnect yes
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo nmcli connection modify "eth0-static" connection.autoconnect-priority 10
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo nmcli connection modify "eth0-dhcp" connection.autoconnect-priority 20
```

After static IP is assigned, run the command below to test the connection. If you get a reply Ethernet connection is
successful.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ ping 10.0.0.2
```

#### 2.2.2. Clone example projects with Git

```bash
ubuntu@host:~$ git clone https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples.git
ubuntu@host:~$ cd examples
```

#### 2.2.3. Install toolchain and additional tools needed for compilation

```bash
ubuntu@host:examples$ ./setup.sh
ubuntu@host:examples$ devbox shell
ubuntu@host:examples$ task fetch
```

#### 2.2.4. Cross compile an example project using the toolchain

```bash
ubuntu@host:examples$ PROJECT=magnetometer task build
```

#### 2.2.5. Upload compiled project into the development board

```bash
ubuntu@host:examples$ scp -r build/examples gemstone@10.0.0.1:build
```

#### 2.2.6. Run the compiled project

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo ./build/magnetometer/c/magnetometer
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo ./build/magnetometer/cpp/magnetometer
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo ./build/magnetometer/python/magnetometer
```
