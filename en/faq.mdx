    If taking a screenshot of the website, the Microsoft Edge browser should be used, and the resolution should not
    exceed 1280x720.

    Documents, etc.

    * When adding photos or images to projects or documentation, the resolution of the visuals should not be too
    high, and the file size of the added image should not exceed 1 MB. Examples can be taken by looking at other
