<Accordion title="What are the Development Rules?">
    Various development standards are specified below for those who want to contribute to open-source projects by
    joining the Gemstone community.

    * The first and fundamental principle in all work should be based on **simplicity and understandability**.
    Overly complex code patterns should be avoided.

    * There should be no commented-out or unused code or functions in the code of software projects.

    * To ensure integrity in the documents, the Light Theme should be used in all window screenshots provided.
    If taking a screenshot of the website, the Microsoft Edge browser should be used, and the resolution should not
    exceed 1280x720.

    * Grammar and spelling rules should be paid attention to when writing anywhere, including the forum, GitHub,
    Documents, etc.

    * When adding photos or images to projects or documentation, the resolution of the visuals should not be too
    high, and the file size of the added image should not exceed 1 MB. Examples can be taken by looking at other
    photos in the ecosystem. Click [here](https://leerob.com/docs) for tips on writing documentation.

    * In all works (Development, Documentation, etc.), when writing descriptions, the `"Why"`, `"What"`, `"How"`
    principle should be followed; meaning "Why was this work done, what was done, how was it done?". For example,
    when examining the work at [this link](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/pull/23), it explains
    "that challenge exists, what that challenge was solved, and what was done to solve it".
    Similarly, when preparing a README file for a new project, why the project was created (define the problem)
    should come first, followed by what was done (what was done for the solution), and finally, an explanation of
    what the work does (or how to use it if it is an application).
