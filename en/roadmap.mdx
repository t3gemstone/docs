## Apache Nuttx

Pixhawk [Flight Controller](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/flight_controller/cubepilot_cube_orangeplus.html)
hardware mostly contains STM32 with Cortex-M architecture. The autopilot named PX4 runs on the real-time operating
system named Apache Nuttx and does not have support for Texas AM67a.

This project aims to run Apache Nuttx and PX4 on the Cortex-R5 cores found on T3-GEM-O1 development boards. The current
status and pending tasks are in the table below.

## PX4 Autopilot

The goal is to run the PX4 autopilot on Gemstone Linux (without NuttX).

## Buildroot

Support for Gemstone will be added to Buildroot, a Linux build system with a somewhat lighter structure compared 
to the Yocto Project. The goal is for a person downloading buildroot to see `T3-GEM-O1` as a board in the
official buildroot system, and to be able to compile and load two image types named `Minimal` and `Kiosk` onto the
development board.

| Creating two image types named Minimal and Kiosk and similarly creating a merge request                     | Volunteer Developer Needed     |

## Phoenix RTOS

The goal is to run the open-source real-time operating system Phoenix, which has a microkernel architecture 
on Gemstone.
